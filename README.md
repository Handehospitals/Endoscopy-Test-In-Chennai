# Endoscopy-Test-In-Chennai
Endoscopy Test in Chennai is a non-surgical procedure that is performed in order to examine a personâ€™s digestive tract. It is done using a flexible tube or an endoscope with a light and camera attached to it, by which it can help the physician to view pictures of the digestive tract on a TV monitor and help the patient to get treated in an appropriate manner. During an Upper GI Endoscopy, an endoscope can be easily passed through the mouth, throat, or into the oesophagus which further allows the doctor to view the stomach, oesophagus, and upper part of the small intestine. The same can be done when endoscopes are passed into the large intestine through the rectum to examine the intestinal area.
